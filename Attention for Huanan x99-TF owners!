There is a file called "HuananzhiX99-TF_BIOS.7z" In this file bios file size are 16 megabytes. But, by using AMI bios utility afudos and afuwin utilities extract bios file being 8 megabytes. There are 2 different bios builds, new one Version 5.11 [10-28-2019] and older one Version 5.11 [08-25-2019] the difference between those files are not known. There is no information. To read bios file at dos, afudos filename.rom /O (not zero, Oranges O) and to flash the bios afudos newbios.rom /P /B /N /R /X parameters have to be used. /X is necessary if modification is done for the bios file. HWiNFO64 and similar programs also inform the original untouhed bios file size being 8 megabyte. For that reason, the modded "HuananzhiX99-TF_BIOS.7z" file contents are not optimally prepared. I recommend not to use them! Meanwhile the bios chip on mainboard is in 16 megabyte capacity. It can hold 16 megabyte file size yes, but the firm did not choose to prepare bios file at that size. I personally updated 2 older bios microcode update files manually. This can be done easier by using latest UBU bios modification utility. For 06F2 3D --> 06F2 43 and for 06F1 2E --> 06F1 38 microcodes are newer!
